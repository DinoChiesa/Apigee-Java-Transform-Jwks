<AssignMessage name='AM-Disable-Copy-Pathsuffix'>

  <!--
      By default, Apigee appends the path suffix provided to the Apigee proxy,
      to the request initiated to the upstream system.  Use this variable to
      turn that behavior OFF, so that the URL the target sees is exactly the URL
      as configured in the TargetEndppoint.
